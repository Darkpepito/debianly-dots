[Original post is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/145xwu4/i3radius_debianly_or_my_os_back_to_its_origins/)

## Instructions
1. Save your actual config and put all the content of `paste-content-in-home` in your home directory
2. Install the fonts in the `font` folder
3. Use dconf command to load `terminal-profile.dconf` in a preset (instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/fdaciuk/9ec4d8afc32063a6f74a21f8308e3807))
4. Replace `neofetch` by the one included in the dots or just put it in `~/.local/bin`
5. Adapt config to your needs :) If you have any problem or questions, open an issue !
